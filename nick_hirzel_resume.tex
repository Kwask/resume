\subsection{Law Office of Gerard Lynch. Houston, TX}
\textbf{Software Engineer \& Data Analyst}, \textit{May. 2021 --- Present}\\
\vspace{0.15em}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Managed the migration process of the firm's legacy database containing 35+ years of legal cases into a newer CMS. Consolidated tech resources in-house from prior contractors, such as domain names, social media listings, and web hosts.
        \item Designed a Python program to automatically clean and transform the exported SQL database, requiring close collaboration to fine-tune the migration. Successfully migrated sensitive financial, medical, and case records, resulting in over 99\% of data transferred.
        \item Developed integrations to streamline office operations, saving dozens of hours of labor weekly. Authored a Google App Script app to pull case information to automatically fill client letters and forms. Created a multiprocessing Flask web app to use the API of the new CMS to test \& validate our migration, generate reports, and enable remote backups.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Wright State University. Dayton, OH}
\textbf{Laboratory Instructor}, \textit{May. 2019 --- May. 2021}\\
\vspace{0.15em}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instructed lab sections and held office hours for Java programming courses, helping students stay productive on coursework. Adapted to remote teaching during the COVID pandemic, learning to effectively run virtual lab sessions and answer questions online.
        \item Graded student projects, requiring rapid code comprehension to provide written feedback. Improved efficiency by creating a sophisticated Bash tool to compile \& run tests against student solutions, doubling the available time for reading code and writing evaluations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}


\vspace{0.4em}
\textbf{Computer Science Tutor}, \textit{Aug. 2019 --- May. 2021}\\
\vspace{0.15em}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tutored an average of 25+ students weekly in C++, Python, and Java programming, as well as staying up-to-date on material from multiple concurrent CS courses. 
        \item Maintained a positive, patient attitude and enjoyed adapting my teaching style to best fit each student. Measurably improved overall course grades in tutored courses.
